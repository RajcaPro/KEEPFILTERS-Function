# KEEPFILTERS-Function
----------
As you already know, the filtering arguments in CALCULATE override any previously existing filters for the same columns.
That’s why the presented measure “Computer Sales” returns sales for the category "Computers," regardless of the existing filter on the “Product[Category]” column.

CALCULATE replaces the existing filters on the columns when applying a new filter. All other columns involved in the filter context remain unchanged.
But what if we don’t want to replace the existing filters? This is where KEEPFILTERS comes to the rescue ✨
Let’s assume we want to show the sales for the "Computers" category when it’s part of the filter context and return a blank value if it’s not.

Let’s apply the following measure:

Our measure "Computers_KeepFilter" shows the sales for "Computers" only in the row for the "Computers" category and in the total.

KEEPFILTERS, instead of replacing the existing filter, keeps it and adds a new filter to it. Since KEEPFILTERS does not replace the filter, the new filter generated by the CALCULATE argument is added to the context.

Let’s look at another example to better visualize the results.
Let’s select two categories: "Computers" and "Cell phones."

Now, let’s present this measure using the KEEPFILTERS function.

Result:

The measure "Computers&Cell phones" shows us the summed values for these categories in the entire column, while "KeepFilters_Computers&CellPhones" shows individual values for the "Computers" and "Cell phones" categories.
KEEPFILTERS can be used with both a logical condition and a table.

That’s the end of this post!

I hope you will use it in your work 🚀
